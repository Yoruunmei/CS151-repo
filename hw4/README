1a) Notice that in Unsynced deposit/withdraw history, the lines don't always alternate between "history" and "current amt".
	Sometimes it prints the "history" from the withdraw/deposit methods from both threads without printing the "Current amt" immediately after the "history".
	eg: history:
		history:
		current amt:
	instead of:
		history:
		current amt:
		history:
	Also, sometimes a deposit/withdraw is missing because it was overwritten.
	Also, the CORRECT net "amt:" should be = 1,000,000. Running the program several times may yield other values other than the correct 1,000,000 under the unsynchronized results.
	
	 
1b) Notice that under "Running SYNCED deposits/withdraws", the lines always alternate between "history" and "current amt". 
	Also, the history of deposits/withdraws always includes all deposits/withdraws.
	Also, the final net "amt:" is always correct = 1,000,000.
