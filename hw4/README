1a) Notice that in Unsynced deposit/withdraw history, the lines don't always alternate between "history" and "current amt".
	Sometimes it prints the "history" from the withdraw/deposit methods from both threads without printing the "Current amt" immediately after the "history".
	eg: history:
		history:
		current amt:
	instead of:
		history:
		current amt:
		history:
	Also, the deposit and withdraw history is not always ordered like above when synced.
	eg: history is 20000, 10000, 20001, 10001 instead of 20000, 20001, 10000, 10001 or 10000, 10001, 20000, 20001
